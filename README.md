# Earth Rover Base
An Open Source rover for use in agriculture

This will be a curated collection of hardware and software resoiurces to help those working in agricultural robotics. The complete collection will provide a robotic base unit suitable for outdoor use that has high quality RTK GPS, robust localisation, and path planning.

We want to pull together existing Open Source ROS and other software, new ROS packages, best practices in agricultrual robotics and tried and tested hardware and configurations to offer a reliable and capable agricultrual ROS platform.
